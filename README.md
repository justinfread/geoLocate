# geoLocate
This project demonstrates how to create a node.js express server, an NeDB database, and pass data to and from the server. It uses the fetch() function to make get and post request to pass data from the client to the server and vise-versa, the find() function to query the server, a link to that documentation is included in the comments, and a host of other things. I would like to give credit Daniel Shiffman, although my project is slightly different, I did base it off of a tutorial of his that I also provide link for in the comments which I really enjoyed and learned a lot from.

The APIs in this project don't require any keys, so all that needs to be done to run this code is to add a database.db file to the public folder and run it.

The code is heavily commented in an explanatory fashion.

Permission is needed from the client to geolocate.
