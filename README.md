# geoLocate
This project demonstrates how to create a node.js express server, an NeDB database, and pass data to and from the server.

The APIs in this project don't require any keys, so all that needs to be done to run this code is to add a database.db file to the public folder and run it.

The code is heavily commented in an explanatory fashion.

Permission is needed from the client to geolocate.
